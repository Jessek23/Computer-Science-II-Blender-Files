# Computer-Science-II-Blender-Files

Welcome to my repository for Computer Science II, it contains 3 main folders for the main files I'll be using for class. A folder for Assets which I will be using in my blender projects. A project file folder which contains my blender projects as they currently are. And a renders folder, for the pictures of the blender files as rendered.
